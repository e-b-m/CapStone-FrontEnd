<h1 align="center" >Orbit: Carer Management Platform </h1>

## Project Description 

Orbit is a task management site for carers, it has been designed to make it simple for carers to add tasks that need to be done for their caree. 

This app works directly with the Orbit Backend API, which can be found [here](https://github.com/saragilani/CapStone-BackEnd). Follow their set up instructions before you get started installing Orbit. 


## Features 
*  Users - can `login` or `signup` to access or create their `User` profile. 

* User Profile - renders information about the user including the `to-do` tasks for their caree. The user will also have control of the `caree` page. 

* Caree Profile - renders information about the caree. The `user` can add a need for the caree and also assign a need to themselves.
